## About The Project

This project summarizes an application of data science to banking.

Banks these days more than need to judge a customer's ability to repay a loan that has been granted to them. The two traditional blockers in this problem are judgmental bias and sluggish analysis.
Thus this project not only provides an automatic eligibility determination of the client, but also a safer decision-making because of the model built from real data, taking into account all the parameters.

Three algorithms have been implemented from scratch in the python language including:

- Classic decision trees according to the CART method

- Bagging set decision trees

- XGBOOST boosting set decision trees

## Built With

We used the following languages and librairies

* [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/)
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
